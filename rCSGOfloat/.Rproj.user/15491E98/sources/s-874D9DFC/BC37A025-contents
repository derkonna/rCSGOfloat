\title{
Output float and condition calculation for trade-up contracts
}
\description{
This function returns the float and condition of the skin(s) you want to trade up to. A helpful resource for finding the float boundaries is https://csgostash.com/
}
\usage{
floatCalc(skinFloats, min, max)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{skinFloats}{
    A numeric vector of length 10 consisting of the float values of the input skins of your trade up contract.
}
  \item{min}{
    The upper boundary of the float value of the skin you want to trade up to.
  }
    \item{max}{
    The lower boundary of the float value of the skin you want to trade up to.
  }
